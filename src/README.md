Here you should have the code for your project, so to make it accessible to the Mentor team and for yourselves to have somewhere to store it.

## How to store your code
This widely depends on what you're working on, but as a start, make sure folder and file names are self-explanatory. For example, if your code checks the temperature and turns an LED if is higher than 30, you could use: LED_Over_Temperature.ino . Moreover, store your code in folders, where each represents a part of your project. 

    If you only use one code for your project, that's fine, but make sure you label which one is the latest version or which one works.
